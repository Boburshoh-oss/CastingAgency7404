Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree capstone project - Casting Ageny

## Motivation

This project is the capstone project for `Udacity Full Stack web development nanondegree`.

This project covers all the learnt concepts that were covered by the nanodegree which includes data modeling for web using `postgres`, API development and testing with `Flask`, Authorization with RBAC, `JWT` authentication and finally API deployment using `Heroku`.

## Start the project locally

This section will introduce you to how to run and setup the app locally.

### Dependencies

This project is based on `Python 3` and `Flask`.

To install project dependencies:

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: you must have the latest version of Python 3

### Local Database connection

- You need to install and start `postgres` database.
- You need to update the database_params variable found in `config.py` file as shown below:

```python
database_param = {
    "username": "postgres",
    "password": "YOUR_DB_PASSWORD",
    "db_name": "capstone",
    "dialect": "postgresql"
}
```

Note: you can create a db named `capstone` by using `createdb` command as shown below:


**Permissions**:
  ```code
    - casting_assistant:
        - `get:actors`
        - `get:movies`
    - casting_director:
        - All permissions of assistant
        -  `create:actors`
        -  `delete:actors`
        -  `get:actors`
        -  `get:movies`
        -  `update:actors`
        -  `update:movies`
    - executive_producer:
        - All permissions of director
        - `create:actors`
        - `create:movies`
        - `delete:actors`
        - `delete:movies`
        - `get:actors`
        - `get:movies`
        - `update:actors`
        - `update:movies`
  ```

  **To testing API, I`ve prepared three accounts**:
  ```code
    - Assistant account:
        - **email**: udacityjon@mail.ru
    - Director account:
        - **email**: muvaffaqiyat12@mail.ru
    - Executive Producer:
        - **email**: intelligent_7404@gmail.ru
    - Password:
        - **Boburshoh777!**
  ```

## Login to accounts*:
### To `login/signup` you should go to the page: [login/signup](https://capstone-7404.us.auth0.com/authorize?

### After `login/signup` get token from url, this token is used to send requests to API endpoints
### Let's decode jwt, to decode jwt navigate to jwt.io website
### To logout, naviagte to page: https://capstone-7404.us.auth0.com/logout

# Testing
* First of all ran all commands in Run application section!
* Firstly you should create database for API testing and change database_path on ` test_app.py ` file, and setup environment variables

##Run app
